# Voronoi Diagram using Fortunes Sweep Algorithm
Implemented as a part of the course CS603 - Geometric Algorithms under Prof. Sujoy Bhore

Running Instructions:

1. Create a text file input.txt(say) with the inputs in the following format
<number of sites>
<site 1 x> <site 1 y> 
    .
    .
    .
<site n x> <site n y>
<query point x> <query point y>

2. Keep the files run.sh, voronoi.py and input.txt in the same directory and run
./run.sh < input.txt
